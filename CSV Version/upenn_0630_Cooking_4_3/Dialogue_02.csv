SPEAKER_01,I saw a person filming themselves cutting up some vegetables.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,"I could see he had a camera on his head filming the actual vegetables, but then the camera is actually filming him as well doing that.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"Okay yeah, So I could see a few of the two other people in the room and one person was really bored and looked like they were talking over what was going on.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,Ooo,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,And the person who set up the camera seemed to be interested at first and then sat down and they appeared to have a conversation between the two of them and not really being concerned.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,Also the person making the salad was so slow.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,Hahaha yeah,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,The way he was chopping.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,He obviously had brilliant knife skills.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,Oh yeah,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,"When you saw the things were coming off, they were fantastic.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,But the pace.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, my own perspective, it was just him for most of the video.",OPINION
SPEAKER_00,Mhmm,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_01,I just saw like the side of both of them going on the side of the video.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,So I don't even know their faces or anything.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,"And yeah, it was just him for the most part.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, so there was an armchair that one of the people, actually it was a couple of armchairs, and they just sat down like this in a way.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"So if you were the person doing the thing, it was like, not periodically, it looked like he was saying things.",DECLARATIVE YES-NO-QUESTION
SPEAKER_00,"Obviously you couldn't hear what he was saying, but it looked like he was talking.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,"Okay, to the other person?",OPEN-QUESTION
SPEAKER_00,"Yes, to the person who was operating the camera, who'd also sat down and was not paying attention.",YES ANSWERS

SPEAKER_00,Yes,YES ANSWERS
SPEAKER_01,the other people that you're talking about okay okay ,BACKCHANNEL-QUESTION
SPEAKER_00,yeah so the person doing the demonstration they were,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,uhuh,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,concentrating and doing what they're doing but these other two people in the room was as if they take record and they're not cared so there was a,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,ohhh okay...,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_01,"It seems like you had a more interesting perspective, because besides the actual chef, it was just like the pots and the oven and stuff.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,There wasn't really much activity outside of... ,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"It was a little, but what was most interesting was what was outside the window. There was a window in the top left corner, and I kept on trying to work out where it was.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,We were obviously up high in an apartment.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,because I was thinking that salad is pretty boring and it's not particularly appetizing so it wasn't he wasn't somebody creating with passion it was just that they were there's your ingredients put these together and in the salad so one thing with chefs is you're always supposed to taste as you as you go and put a single thing in his mouth so there was no yeah very mundane,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,YES ANSWERS
SPEAKER_00,"So if that was somebody preparing a YouTube video, then I don't imagine many people would want to watch it.",OPINION
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,YES ANSWERS
SPEAKER_01,"But that's interesting because I think since he was the only one I saw for the most part, I didn't see it as boring.",OPINION
SPEAKER_01,I just realized I had to concentrate on what he was cutting.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,uhuh,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_01,I was even going to ask if I had to count how many slices.,WH-QUESTION
SPEAKER_01,Maybe that was important for this discussion because there wasn't much else happening outside of what he was doing.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,uhuh,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_01,But yeah.,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,I'm more of a fan of watching people who are enthusiastic about what they do.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,hmmm yeah...,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,So the most video demonstrations of cooks that are popular,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,we get a little story about what they're doing or they'll explain why they're using a particular thing or the other.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"I know the soundtrack wasn't there, so they might have been doing that, but there was no sense of gesticulation that would come when somebody is passionate about what they do.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,Hm.,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,So I was more paying attention to how the people were interacting with each other and whether they were doing something that they had to do or something they wanted to do.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,So that was my impression.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"And then, in hindsight, I was thinking I wouldn't want to use that kitchen because the sink's underneath the cupboard and you don't see out the window.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"So for the purposes of cooking, it wouldn't be a very nice place to cook in.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,But they had some nice ingredients.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,Yeah.,YES ANSWERS
SPEAKER_00,So what did you feel about the purpose?,OPEN-QUESTION
SPEAKER_00,Did you think somebody was making a video for other people to watch?,YES-NO-QUESTION
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, that's what it felt like.",AGREEMENT/ACCEPT
SPEAKER_01,yeah i don't really have much much thought because there was not like i said there was not much there wasn't anything going on really outside of him everything else was like an inanimate object so so my focus was just on the ingredients ,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"Mhmm, and wht did you make of the ingredients?",BACKCHANNEL-QUESTION
SPEAKER_01,to be honest i didn't even know that was what he was making you know he said he was making the salad i just,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00, But did they look fresh? Did they look good quality?,YES-NO-QUESTION
SPEAKER_00,"Did they look unusual, things that you'd recognised or things that you'd never come across before?",WH-QUESTION
SPEAKER_01,"Oh, yeah, I recognised them, but I couldn't just figure out what it was.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,"Like you said, I paid attention to how well he was cutting the cucumbers, apart from one that was a bit bigger than the rest.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,haha yes,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, he has nice cutting skills, but that was about it.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,Did you get to see a sort of plastic bottle?,YES-NO-QUESTION
SPEAKER_00,uh like a coke bottle but had some sort of lettering on the side of it there's always one i was curious and the lettering was in in the language that i don't understand so i have no idea ,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,was that on the table? ,YES-NO-QUESTION
SPEAKER_00,yes,YES ANSWERS
SPEAKER_01,like beside the vegetables ,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,there was chopping here and then there was this big plastic bottle here and it had some lettering on it and i was just i was curious he didn't use it at all i was just curious to what it was,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,Oh I didnÃt see that,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_01,I'm not sure if I just didn't notice or it wasn't there.,HEDGE
SPEAKER_00,It wasn't in your camera shot?,YES-NO-QUESTION
SPEAKER_01,Maybe.,MAYBE/ACCEPT-PART
SPEAKER_00,So I was looking down. Like that,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,okay,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,and I could see out the window there it was an extreme wide angle so it was more vignetted around there it wasn't a straight shot and the person who wasn't interested was obviously the director was sitting there facing that way but the action was going here the camera person set up the camera here then quickly lost interest in it and went down,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,and then only came back at the end to check that everything had been done properly and they appeared to be talking to each other over what was doing here so I was hoping it would be a rehearsal for final take and also on all cookery things you always record it twice so you'll do a wide shot first to get a sense of what's going on and then you'll go in and you'll do close-ups so do you ever watch the bake-off?,DECLARATIVE YES-NO-QUESTION
SPEAKER_01,"No, the Great British Bake-Off?.",YES-NO-QUESTION
SPEAKER_01,I've never watched that,NO ANSWERS
SPEAKER_00,The one reason they wear the same clothes two days in a running is so that you can do pickups the day after so everyone's already wearing the right clothes so you can go in and film things that are missed.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,ohh I just thought that was the reason for like the multiple cameras to get like different angles they still need to do that,SUMMARIZE/REFORMULATE
SPEAKER_00,they'll do it they'll do it minimum twice so you have to repeat the the recipe and very often the person- a lot of things are prepped in a separate prepping kitchen off off there obviously not in that type of scenario yeah so i was more interested in,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,how unprofessional it looked.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,I was like Seriously? Haha,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,"hahaha, Makes sense.",BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_01,I don't have much else to add really.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,Was it appetising?,YES-NO-QUESTION
SPEAKER_00,Did you think you wanted to eat that?,YES-NO-QUESTION
SPEAKER_01,"No, no.",NO ANSWERS
SPEAKER_00,I thought it was pretty bland as well.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, it kind of looked dry, I don't know.",OPINION
SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, because when you were cutting the onion and things, you didn't see the moisture coming out the onion onto the board.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,mhmmm,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,"and the yeah it's It's old mushrooms, well it's actually either rotten mushrooms that have lost their moisture, or ones that have been left to dry.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"But either way, it didn't look nice.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, I agree.",AGREEMENT/ACCEPT
SPEAKER_00,"And also with any cooking thing, I always like to see that somebody's washed their hands before they start.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,hahaha oh yeah ,NON-VERBAL
SPEAKER_00,I always have a bowl with soapy water in it so that even before I start cooking it's in there and everywhere it's getting washed and in between it can go back into the soapy water but what else could I think of,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"Things were arrayed out on the table so they were easy to find, but the camera didn't seem to move at all.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"The person wearing the camera moved a lot, but the camera that was filming it was a fixed perspective.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,Yeah,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,It never got moved.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,and there was a sort of wooden floor which looked a bit like laminate and they put the floor pattern the wrong way round so it had been laid in correctly if I remember correctly so when you do laminates what you do is you make the lines go to the narrowest point not the longest point because although it gives the visual illusion that the room's too wide and too thin,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,oh.,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,yeah so the flooring was the wrong way around but I could be wrong it's just in hindsight I was just thinking I was thinking something's wrong with that flooring and that could be what it was,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,so how could we bring this together because I imagine that I just saw from the camera that you you know like you know you said that there were people there then the camera and then him so I think I was just seeing from this camera's point of view like in front of people so I think we still saw basically the same thing,SUMMARIZE/REFORMULATE
SPEAKER_00,yes we did just with different perspective,AGREEMENT/ACCEPT
SPEAKER_01, yeah having more,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,I had more context yeah but possibly less detail.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,And you probably have more detail but less context.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,Hm yeah ,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,so the I was finding it quite disorientating at points as well because he would move around suddenly and the camera would come with him so I'd see what he was doing at the sink and again he was making token gestures of putting water on top of vegetables but it really was token in case of yeah there's just splashing a little water on it's not getting cleaned properly and I saw the state of the sink and I was thinking,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,hahaha yes,NON-VERBAL
SPEAKER_00,"So if anything, seeing that extra perspective made me less likely to want to eat it.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,Because I could see what else was going on.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"Well, there's three people there.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"We know what their task is, what they're there for.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,We know where they're located.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,They're located in an upper flat in a city centre.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,So it's not a professional studio that's been shot in.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"I'm more familiar with the equipment that they were using, the position of the cameras, and he seemed to be wearing some sort of head-mounted thing.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"So I got his body camera perspective, but he also seemed to have something going on above his head, pointing at him, which is possibly the camera that you had.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,mmh yeah,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,"We also know that they had some skills, but were not a professional chef, because I could see that from the chopping from here.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"So he was using the way I would chop, which the fingers exposed, whereas a professional chef does the sort of knuckle thing like that.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,So they're an amateur at what they do.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00,"but they appeared to be following a script, as in do this, then this, then this, and show that, so it wasn't accidental.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,mhmm yep,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,"And, yeah, they seemed to take five minutes to prepare a side that should have taken 30 seconds to a minute.",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,hahaha Yeah.,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,And I think it was a relatively young man that was doing it.,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,oh yeah,BACKCHANNEL/ACKNOWLEDGE
SPEAKER_00,rather than a younger woman or...,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_00, and as to why they were doing it i got the sense that it was set up for this experiment it wasn't a case of something that would occur naturally because if it was occurring naturally and they did want viewers they wouldn't do it that way ,STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,yeah i think so,AGREEMENT/ACCEPT
