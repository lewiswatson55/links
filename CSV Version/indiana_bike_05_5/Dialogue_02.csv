SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, I could see him putting the DW40...",STATEMENT
SPEAKER_01,on the chain to make sure it would run and then take any excess grease off of it but it's hard to see the actual condition of the chain in the first place to know whether it was rusty and he's using the oil to get like the rust and stuff off or whether it was just off centre and he's attaching it but it wasn't like a kind of metal bright silver that you do get from a new bike chain it appeared you know darker in colour so you can assume that it's old ,STATEMENT
